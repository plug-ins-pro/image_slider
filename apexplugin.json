The UC - Image Slider is a region plug-in that displays a gallery of lazily loaded images. It is based on the modern Swiper slider (https://swiperjs.com/) which also supports mobile devices, accelerated transitions, and native behavior. This plug-in offers the most commonly used features such as autoplaying, looping, thumbnail gallery, different display modes/sizes for the images, and so on. It offers various slide-transition options and a built-in description box which can be easily customized using CSS if necessary.",
